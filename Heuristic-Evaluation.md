# Open Labyrinth Heuristic Evaluation Report

**Nielsen&#39;s Usability Heuristics**

**1.Visibility of system status**

The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.

**2. Match between system and the real world**

The system should speak the users&#39; language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.

**3.User control and freedom**

Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked &quot;emergency exit&quot; to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.

**4.Consistency and standards**

Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing.

**5.Error prevention**

Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.

**6.Recognition rather than recall**

Minimize the user&#39;s memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.

**7.Flexibility and efficiency of use**

Accelerators -- unseen by the novice user -- may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.

**8.Aesthetic and minimalist design**

Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.

**9.Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**

Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.

**10. Help and documentation**

Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user&#39;s task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.

The usability problems found from this evaluation are clustered into eleven areas and are ranked according to their severity and ease with which the problem can be solved.

Table 3. Severity rankings [6]

| Rating | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Violates a heuristic but doesn&#39;t seem to be a usability problem. |
| 2 | Superficial usability problem: may be easily overcome by user or occurs extremely infrequently. Does not need to be fixed for next release unless extra time is available. |
| 3 | Minor usability problem: may occur more frequently or be more difficult to overcome. Fixing this should be given low priority for next release. |
| 4 | Major usability problem: occurs frequently and persistently or users may be unable or unaware of how to fix the problem. Important to fix, so should be given high priority. |
| 5 | Usability catastrophe: Seriously impairs use of product and cannot be overcome by users. Imperative to fix this before product can be released. |

Table 4. Ease of fixing rankings [9]

| Rating | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Problem would be extremely easy to fix. Could be completed by one team member before next release. |
| 2 | Problem would be easy to fix. Involves specific interface elements and solution is clear. |
| 3 | Problem would require some effort to fix. Involves multiple aspects of the interface or would require team of developers to implement changes before next release or solution is not clear. |
| 4 | Usability problem would be difficult to fix. Requires concentrated development effort to finish before next release, involves multiple aspects of interface. Solution may not be immediately obvious or may be disputed. |
