# Open Labyrinth Heuristic Evaluation Report

# The WAVES Project

The WAVES project combines skill sets of both academic and enterprise partners to make Scenario-based learning (SBL) more accessible for a wide range of professions.  SBL techniques are widely recognised as a key tool in the educational toolkit, for safe training in competency and decision-making.

# What is the repository for

This report provides a detailed analysis of the heuristic evaluation process used to evaluate Open Labyrinth version 3.3 (OL). The evaluation itself was performed using the heuristic evaluation usability method, based on heuristics provided by Jakob Nielsen [1]. This method consists of evaluators comparing a pre-defined set of usability principles to an application or website while attempting to complete a system task. 

For this project, nine heuristics were used, focusing on the core functionalities of OL: displaying, creating and playing virtual patients (VPs). The goal of this evaluation was to identify major usability flaws within the OL interface through the application Nielsen's heuristics.
